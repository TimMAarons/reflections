When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If other users wanted to work on the files I would use remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Not sure.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Clones would be used on copies of your own GitHub repositories or others that you won't want to collaborate on or share publically.
Forks are used to copy other repositories created by other users and to give them credit and possible for collaboration purposes.   
Branches are versions of individual files, as opposed to a repository that is a collection of versions of a group of files.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
If you are offline you can still compare and work on files.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
You would have to transfer files differently.   Comparing files would probably take more time depending on how you did it.  Merging files would probably be tedious and coordination between updates difficult.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

You could use a branch when you want more than one version of a file, such as easy vs hard mode.  Or when you want to work on changes without modifying the master.
