What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
You create a new repository with a clean commit log.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area lets you put files in a "container" prior to placing into a repository.  Honestly, I'm not sure why this benefit.
